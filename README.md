# Simple-Online-Movie-Ticket-Booking-Page

This movie ticket booking project is built using Node.js,Express, and MongoDB for back-end operations. Users can select a movie, choose seats, and book tickets through a simple front-end interface powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bookings are stored in MongoDB with details like movie name, theater, date, selected seats, and price. The back-end handles routes for ticket booking, validates user input, and ensures successful database storage. The server serves static files and communicates with the client via RESTful API endpoints.
